# A luxury wine sotre app (React Js)

I built a Wine Store App that allows customers add items to cart,

customers can then click on the cart icon to checkout and pay,

When that customer adds item to the cart, the item is saved to his/her computer memory using

the localstorage api, so that items are not lost when the customer refreshes

the page or comes back later to the website.

You can view the production site, [Here's the Link](http://osas-store.netlify.app)
